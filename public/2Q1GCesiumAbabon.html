        <p> Matilda is a musical that was based on Roald Dahl's 1988 novel named Matilda. The musical tells the story of a young girl named Matilda Wormwood, who is known to be smart and brilliant. Not only that, she also posesses telekinetic abilities, and uses her imagination and intelligence to stand up to the evil headmistress of her school, Mrs. Trunchbull, and her neglectful parents. She gets help from a kind and caring teacher, Ms. Honey, who helps make her life better. </p>
